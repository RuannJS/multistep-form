Welcome to the Multi-Step Form Challenge! The goal of this challenge is to build a multi-step form that allows users to seamlessly progress through each step, make selections, go back to update their choices, and finally, confirm their order. Additionally, the form should provide a responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.

## Technologies Used

  Users can navigate through each step of the form, completing the required information at their own pace.

- **Back Navigation:**
  Users can easily go back to previous steps to update or change their selections.

- **Summary Confirmation:**
  On the final step, users can review a summary of their selections before confirming their order.

- **Responsive Design:**
  The form layout adjusts to provide an optimal viewing experience on different screen sizes and devices.

- **Interactive Elements:**
  All interactive elements, such as buttons, should have hover and focus states for a better user experience.

- **Form Validation:**
  Users receive clear validation messages if:
    - A required field has been missed.
    - The email address is not formatted correctly.
    - A step is submitted without making any selection.
